      This key represents either <kbd>cmd</kbd>/<kbd>⌘</kbd> on macOS or{" "}

      Brackets work really well for me here, and shift keys work really poorly
      for me here, so this odd key placement is a win-win for me.
    </Para>
    <Para>
      The most important aspect of this placement is that it is <em>not</em> a{" "}
      <kbd>shift</kbd> key. When I first got my ErgoDox, using shift with either
      hand had become excruciating, and I desperately needed to shift without
      using my pinky. To accomplish this, I remapped{" "}
      <Indicator id="l-t-1-3">
        <kbd>shift</kbd>
      </Indicator>{" "}
      to under the thumb. However, moving shift to a new location without
      removing the normal QWERTY shift mapping gave me too much of a crutch, so
      I needed to remove shift from its normal location.
    </Para>
    <Para>
      Even so, why brackets? On the ErgoDox default layout, the brackets are in
      an awkward place anyway, and the shift keys are actually easier to reach
      than the default location for{" "}
      <Indicator id="r-f-9-9">
        <kbd>[</kbd>
      </Indicator>{" "}
      and{" "}

    It&apos;s nice to have dedicated volume keys, but isn&apos;t a necessity.

      Keeping this key out from under my pinky is vital &mdash;{" "}

    </Para>
    <Para>
      Happily, this is a really excellent location for <kbd>ctrl</kbd>, much
      better than the default QWERTY location, and only possible on an ErgoDox,
      because it&apos;s easier to chord with any key on the board.
    </Para>
    <Para>
      On a normal keyboard, I remap the key in the{" "}
      <Indicator id="l-f-1-5">
        <kbd>capslock</kbd>
      </Indicator>{" "}

      This key represents either <kbd>opt</kbd>/<kbd> ⌥</kbd> on macOS or{" "}
      <kbd>alt</kbd> on Windows. This location is easy to hit with your thumb,
      and having two of them means you don&apos;t have to stretch much.
    </Para>
    <Para>
      As <kbd>opt</kbd> + a left/right arrow key is a very common chord,
      it&apos;s worth noting that this placement works well with my{" "}
      <Indicator id="l-f-8-9">left side</Indicator> and{" "}
      <Indicator id="r-f-7-9">right side</Indicator> arrow layer keys. I can
      chord <kbd>opt</kbd>+<kbd>arrow layer</kbd> with one thumb without any
      strain, and use the other hand to move the cursor with the arrow keys.

      from <ExternalLink href="https://tonsky.me/">Nikita</ExternalLink>, who
      has a much nicer website than I do. His solution is really good, but I
      cannot use <kbd>capslock</kbd> to activate the arrow layer; on a normal
      QWERTY keyboard, I must remap that key to <kbd>ctrl</kbd>, and more
      importantly I want to avoid chording keys with my pinky as much as
      possible.

                While the most significant benefit of the ErgoDox is the ability
                to remap keys, see how many keys remain in their default QWERTY
                position. The benefits I got were cheap. I could keep most of
                what I knew from regular keyboards.

                Even for these QWERTY keys, though, there is something special
                about the ErgoDox layout. The keys are <em>ortholinear</em>,
                which means that they are arrayed in neat columns rather than
                offset like a traditional QWERTY keyboard. This way, my fingers
                extend straight out, or curl straight in, to hit any key.
