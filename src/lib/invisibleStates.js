  "WEST DAKOTA":
    "Here, goblets of diesel fuel are burned in offering to the railroad gods. Locals make omelettes using the eggs of rattlesnakes.",
  APSYLANIA:
    "A land of snow and rust where only water towers can survive. Their long, iron tentacles guard the tombs of forgotten presidents.",
  AGASSIZ:
    "A colossal lead heart that connects all sewers throbs just beneath this state's surface. Its palpitations are felt as earthquakes.",
  SELIMA:
    "Known for pan-fried hornets dipped in maple salsa. The Roosevelt National Labyrinth begins near its eastern border, and never ends.",
  OROCROIX:
    "Scarecrows stuffed with telephone wire fill the few ghost towns that remain here. They subsist on our expended alkaline batteries.",

  YALDA:
    "Old mirages have solidified into legal persons in the southern violet deserts. The cacti are infectious; many residents grow needles.",

    "Miles of farmland where most of America's candles are grown. Those aren't mushroom cloudsâ€” that's just what their weather is like.",
  DAGONSA:
    "A desert cooked dry by the moon; there's nothing to see here but blue dunes of powdered water.",
  MOHAVEE:
    "A variant of baseball is played with curved, wooden scimitars. Locals suck on gemstones like gobstoppers until they become opaque.",

    "A benign supervolcano churns beneath its nevergreen trees. The ground oozes a harmless lava that children can sculpt like playdough.",
  HALUTH:
    "A comet struck these lands thousands of years ago, but it never melted. Subterranean ski resorts have been built in its icy intrels.",
  OUTIS:
    "Home of the pyramid featured on the dollar bill's obverse. The entire state is a cellphone deadzone due to colonies of magnetic ants.",

    "The closest state to Mars; it appears larger than the Moon. Edgar Cayce predicted that the last Super Bowl would be fought here.",
  REMINGTON:
    "The sunflowers here watch you instead of the sky, and bare their teeth if approached. Don't get pinched when picking crawberries.",

    "The ancient volcanic calderas that pepper this landscape have been fashioned into barbecue pits where catoblepas herds are cooked.",
  KENASUS:
    "A great sea of windmills tears apart the atmosphere. Astronauts are trained here, as most breathable air is lost to these machines.",

    "The final destination of all train graffiti. The glyphs slither down from their cars and become three-dimensional aberrations.",
  BARNUM:
    'Tycoons often meet in this desert to sip petroleum cider and place bets on how the world will end. Borders the fabled "bat country."',
  KILOTAH:
