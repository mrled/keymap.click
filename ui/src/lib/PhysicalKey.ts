 *              Keyboards with just one sub-board or grid might have just one.
 *              Keyboards with multiple distinct areas like an ErgoDox might have two or more.
 * position:    The position on the board.
 *              Unique for each boardId.
 *              Positions are given in key grid units,
 *              so keyboards which use 2x2 units will have X and Y coordinates as multiples of 2.
 * size:        The size of the key, in key grid units.
 *
 * TODO: We need a different name for these key grid units; these aren't like 1rem, but like 1x or 2x.
