# Physical key indicators

I have textual representations of key locations, like `l-f-1-1`.
This refers to the

- _left_ board
- _finger_ cluster
- column _1_
- row _1_

Note that these are references to key _locations_,
not to the _legend_ printed on the key at that location,
and not to the _key code_ that the board sends to the operating system.

## These are called _indicators_

I don't call them "references" because that's confusing with React refs.
I don't call them "pointers" because I think it's awkward and slightly confusing
because a pointer is something else in programming
(though I guess not in JavaScript)
