Much better than the default Ergodox layout, which shifts these keys down by one, consuming extremely valuable keys [[l-t-5-5|here]] and [[r-t-1-5|here]]. You may or may not find these keys necessary - they tend to be heavily used on Windows (and also in VS Code), and much less useful on macOS. That said, with <kbd>shift</kbd> and <kbd>space</kbd> on opposite hands, <kbd>Page Up</kbd> is the only way you can scroll up one page with only one hand on the keyboard (while on a regular keyboard, <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>space</kbd> will do this).";

Keeping <kbd>GUI</kbd> here makes it very easy to hit any application shortcut without remapping or straining your hands. The default value for this key is <kbd>hyper</kbd> (as <a class="underline" href="https://brettterpstra.com/2012/12/08/a-useful-caps-lock-key/">described by Brett Terpstra</a>), which is only useful for user-defined shortcuts.

However, mapping another key shift but leaving this as a useful shift key gave me too much of a crutch. At the same time, on the Ergodox default layout the <kbd>[</kbd> and <kbd>]</kbd> keys are in an awkward place anyway, and the shift keys are actually easier to reach than the default location for [[r-f-9-9|<kbd>[</kbd>]] and [[r-f-11-9|<kbd>]</kbd>]].
